These secretive Druids have adopted the totem of the Crow. Their primary role in society is information gathering and intelligence. They have the ability to transform into Storm Crows and fly over the field of battle to scout and deliver orders to distant troops. Their magical spell-like abilities are capable of channeling even the winds to fight against the enemies of Kalimdor.<br /><br />The Druid of the Talon is rarely seen but can be useful in several situations. Night Elves can have difficulty vs. heavy armored units. Druids of the Talon can cast Faerie Fire that reduces the enemy's armor and allows the Night Elves to have a much easier time attacking them. Another especially powerful use for Druids of the Talon is Cyclone. Cyclone renders a unit useless for 20 seconds. Druids of the Talon can also be useful in Storm Crow form for reaching islands, for scouting the map, and even for attacking massed enemy air units. Storm Crows can even cast Faerie Fire once you research their upgrade.<br /><br />Although the Druid of the Talon in Storm Crow form has the unarmored armor type, he still has armor.
