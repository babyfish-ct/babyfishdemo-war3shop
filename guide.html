			<h1>Step-I: Start the database server</h1>
			<p>
				There are two ways to run war3shop, standalone hsqldb server or Oracle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oracle is suggested because babyfish supports a functionality named "Oracle Optimization"
				that can markedly optimize the peformance when the database is Oracle,
				but hsqldb standalone server is another choice if there is no Oracle server.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In order to start the hsqldb server, please use this script:                            <div class="code">
						<pre>cd <span class="variable">${war3shop-dir}</span>/install
./start-hsqldb.sh<span class="comment">(For windows: it should'be "start-hsqldb.bat")</span></pre>
					</div>
					<p>Press "Ctrl+C" when it should be stopped.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Orace is suggested, please make sure the Oracle instance is started.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Step-II: Create database schema and import demonstration data</h1>
			<div class="code">
				<pre>cd <span class="variable">${war3shop-dir}</span>/install
./war3shop-install.sh<span class="comment">(For windows: it should'be "war3shop-install.bat")</span></pre>
			</div>
			After this shell(or bat) is started, please answer some questions:
